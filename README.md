### Hi ðŸ‘‹ ! This is Reuben Sun 

- I used to work as a Graphics Algorithm Engineer, but now I'm focusing on AI.
- I used to develop a rendering engine using Vulkan and Metal, and have been involved in commercial self-developed game engine development
- In my spare time, I'm developing a game similar to CK3 and trying to incorporate reinforcement learning elements.
- I enjoy writing notes to record my learning experiences, feel free to leave messages on my [blog](https://reubensun.com).
